The reason is that most women age 35 and above have reached the point at which they will not have more children. In this age group, there are 683 rows. I don't see why women with age above 44 shouldn't be included according to this reason. If we include women older than 44, we'll have more data with 2637 rows. \n",

However, I think it would be beneficial to include other factors in the dataset that may have an influence on the number of children a woman might have. Such variables include religious upbringing, socioeconomic status (would need to find a good measure of this), and possibly race or ethnic background. With these additional factors, the same analysis of number of children vs. years of education could be performed, this time blocking by the values of these new factors."

    "** 1.3 ** Rachael Burns: Both analyses do not adequately handle the effects of outlying values with very low education. The most extreme outlying point, 0 years of education and 5 kids, shows nothing else abnormal, but a look at the full data set shows that a lot of data points with low education have NA in other answers = perhaps these respondents lost interest and picked randomly. Alternative explanations include extreme poverty. I would want to look at the full survey to determine whether or not it truly makes sense to include these points. I would also question my results in light of the effects of these possibly erroneous or highly abnormal data points. Laskowski should have looked at the median value and the quartile values rather than means – this still shows a trend. Given the outliers, Sanders should not have been so quick to make conclusions at the population level from OLS.\n"
