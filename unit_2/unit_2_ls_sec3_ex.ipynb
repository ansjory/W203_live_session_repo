There's nothing in the analysis that distinguishes number of kids from the capability of having kids. We don't really know if those who have higher levels of education choose not to have children or perhaps due to stressful working schedules are incapable of having children. I'd also like to know why men were excluded from the study which wasn't mentioned."
